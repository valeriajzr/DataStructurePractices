## Algorithms and data structure 
The purpose of this repository is purely practice the creation and logic of algorithms as well as data structure
Some examples of what can be find in this repository are:
- personal implementation of Buble sorting algorithms
- personal implementation of Selection sorting algorithms
- functions to evaluate if a string is a palindrome, if a number can be considered real or friendly numbers
